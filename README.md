The Augmented Reality Edge Network Architecture (ARENA) is a platform designed to simplify programming where there is a mix of virtual and physical systems, with locality and pervasive sensing as first-class citizens. ARENA makes it easy to create and host multiple applications that interact with users and other agents in an immersive 3D environment created inside a browser.

ARENA is the main CONIX integrator platform. Its components are under development in the [arenaxr organization](https://github.com/arenaxr).
